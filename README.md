# Contracts-Audit
Here are our smart contract audit reports

## Our Goal
The purpose of the audit was to achieve the following:
- [x] Ensure that the smart contract functions as intended.
- [x] Identify potential security issues with the smart contract.

The information in this report should be used to understand the risk exposure of the smart 
contract, and as a guide to improve the security posture of the smart contract by remediating 
the issues that were identified.

## Audit Steps

cover maximum possible test cases to scan everything.
